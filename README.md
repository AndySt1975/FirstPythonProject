# FirstPythonProject
This project follows the online tutorial from BroCode (youtube) beginner Lesson on python (106 videos)
most of the code is copied from his channel
all .py files are seperate programs (only one or two have extra classes on differnt files)
the folders are only to seperate the content a little bit - it's getting messy really fast...
