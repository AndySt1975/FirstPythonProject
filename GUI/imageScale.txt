 try typing this in the command prompt ... or if you use VS Code like me (my pycharm throws errors whenever I use walrus operators, but code still runs perfectly; outdated pycharm version I guess), type this in the VS Code terminal... (or pycharm terminal if it will work)
"python -m pip install --upgrade pip" (exclude quotation marks) followed by
"python -m pip install --upgrade Pillow" (exclude quotation marks)

afterwards import these in your python file like so...
from PIL import Image
from PIL import ImageTk as itk  

and for resize do this...
image = Image.open("FILEPATH") 
# image.resize((INTVALUE, INTVALUE)) # this also works but creates stretched images
image.thumbnail((50, 50)) # replace 50, 50 with whatever integer value you like but keep the double parenthesis
finalImage = PhotoImage(image)

hope this helps ;)
